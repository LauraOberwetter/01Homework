To increase accessibility and optimize SEO, please see some of the edits that I made to this refactored code:

Edits made to HTML:  

-Changed tab title from "website" to "Horiseon"
-Changed <div> class "header" to <header>
-Changed <div> to <nav>
-Fixed broken link in the <nav> by linking to the correct ID
-Combined classes with identical formatting to reduce redundancies in CSS
-Added the alt tag to all images to allow for screen-reader accessibility
-Changed <div> to <aside>
-Consolodated lead-brand-cost classes to eliminate redundancies
-Edited redundant <img> closing tag
-Changed <div> to <footer> 

Edits made to CSS:

-Increased color contrast for better visibility of brand name within <header>
-Resized the hero image for faster load time
-Lead generation, brand awareness, and cost management sidebar sections are all styled together in <aside>
-Search-engine-optimization, online-reputation-management, and social-media-marketing sections are all styled together in the same class
